Preparation This tutorial assumes that you have already understood the basic usage of Git and Github. If you are not familiar, you can refer to Getting Git right 。\n2.1 Environment You need to install the following environment:\nGit Hugo IDEs that one is accustomed to using, such as VSCode 2.2 Install Hugo I am using a Windows 11 system, and the installation process is as follows:\nInstall Go language，Download - Go Download the archive of Hugo binary file，Hugo - latest release (This article was released on February 11, 2024. If there is a new version, please update it yourself) Extract the archive, move the executable to the desired directory. Add this directory to the PATH environment variable Open the PowerShell, run hugo version. If the version number is displayed, the installation is successful Hugo installation for other systems can refer to Hugo Installation 2.3 Setup Github repository Create two Github repositories, one for storing Hugo blog source code and one for storing static web pages generated by Hugo.\nCreate Github Pages repository\nName it like \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.github.io, \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; is your Github username. This repository is used to store static web pages. Set to Public, otherwise it cannot be accessed through the browser. Check to add README file, which will set the main branch as the default main branch of the repository Create a blog source repository\nName it as you like, this repository is used to store the source code of the Hugo blog. Set it to Public or Private according to your needs. Clone the repository to your local machine as the working directory for creating the Hugo blog. 3. Create a blog with Hugo 3.1 Initialize a Hugo site In your cloned repository folder，open PowerShell and run hugo new site \u0026lt;site_name\u0026gt;，in which \u0026lt;site_name\u0026gt; is up to you to decide. For example:\nhugo new site MyFreshWebsite --format yaml --format yaml It is specified that the configuration file format is in yaml format. I personally think this file format is more intuitive\nAfter creation, generate 7 main folders and 1 file (there are added folders in the figure for reference only) archetypes: article templates content: store the content of the blog data: store data files layouts: store customized templates public: store the generated static web pages static: store static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript themes: store the theme of the blog hugo.yml: the configuration file of the blog 3.2 hugo.yml configuration Open hugo.yml, modify the configuration according to your needs. The following is a simple example:\nbaseURL: \u0026#34;https://\u0026lt;yourname\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026#34; # Your website URL languageCode: en-us title: \u0026lt;Your Nmae\u0026gt; # Your blog title theme: \u0026lt;theme_name\u0026gt; # The theme you want to use enableInlineShortcodes: true # Enable shortcodes enableEmoji: true # Enable emoji enableRobotsTXT: true # Enable robots.txt hasCJKLanguage: true # Enable CJK language support buildDrafts: false buildFuture: false buildExpired: false paginate: 15 # Number of articles per page minify: disableXML: true minifyOutput: true permalinks: # URL format post: \u0026#34;/:title/\u0026#34; defaultContentLanguage: en # Default language defaultContentLanguageInSubdir: true languages: en: languageName: \u0026#34;English\u0026#34; weight: 1 menu: main: - name: Articles url: posts/ weight: 1 - name: Tags url: tags/ weight: 10 - name: Search url: search/ weight: 11 zh: languageName: \u0026#34;中文\u0026#34; weight: 2 menu: main: - name: 文章 url: posts/ weight: 1 - name: 标签 url: tags/ weight: 10 - name: 搜索 url: search/ weight: 11 params: socialIcons: - name: github title: View Source on Github url: \u0026#34;https://github.com/ryanwooa\u0026#34; - name: Instagram url: \u0026#34;https://www.instagram.com/ryanwu5_/\u0026#34; - name: X url: \u0026#34;https://twitter.com/nzw897\u0026#34; - name: linkedin url: \u0026#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-wu-9b8161268/\u0026#34; ShowBreadCrumbs: true ShowRelatedPosts: true ShowPostNavLinks: true ShowCodeCopyButtons: true ShowReadingTime: true label: icon: \u0026#34;q3.png\u0026#34; env: production author: Ryan Wu defaultTheme: auto disableThemeToggle: false DateFormat: \u0026#34;2006-01-02\u0026#34; ShowShareButtons: true ShowReadingTime: true # disableSpecialistPost: true displayFullLangName: true ShowPostNavLinks: true ShowBreadCrumbs: true ShowCodeCopyButtons: true hideFooter: false #hide footer ShowWordCounts: true VisitCount: true ShowLastMod: true #show last modified date ShowToc: true # show table of contents TocOpen: true # expand table of contents by default assets: favicon: \u0026#34;q3.png\u0026#34; favicon16x16: \u0026#34;q3.png\u0026#34; favicon32x32: \u0026#34;q3.png\u0026#34; apple_touch_icon: \u0026#34;q3.png\u0026#34; safari_pinned_tab: \u0026#34;q3.png\u0026#34; outputs: home: - HTML - RSS - JSON # necessary for search taxonomies: tag: tags category: categories 4. Install Hugo theme There are many themes to choose from in the Hugo theme , and you can choose a theme according to your preferences. Taking PaperMod as an example here.\nAccording PaperMod Install/Update ，it can be installed using the following command：\ngit submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod git submodule update --init --recursive # needed when you reclone your repo (submodules may not get cloned automatically) Then you can see that the newly installed theme folder is added to the themes folder.\nConfigure it in hugo.yml file：\ntheme: PaperMod For more PaperMod function you can refer to PaperMod - Features 5. New post If you want to create a new article, you can use the following command to create a new Markdown file:\nhugo new xxx.md hugo new posts/xxx.md # If you want to create a new article in the posts folder The Markdown file created by this command will automatically include some basic information, such as the article title, date, etc. You can edit the article content in the Markdown file.\ndraft = true shows that this article is currently a draft. If you want the article to be displayed on the website, you need to set draft to false or delete this line.\n6. Preview and debug After creating the article, you can use the following command to preview the website locally:\nhugo server Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:1313\n7. Deploy to Github Pages using Github Action GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that can be used to automatically execute build, test, and deployment pipelines. We can use Github Action to automatically deploy the Hugo blog to Github Pages.\n7.1 Create Workflow In the root directory of the project, create a .github/workflows folder, and create a workflow file with a .yml extension. My GitHub Action automatically publishes the file main.yml example configuration is as follows:\nname: GitHub Pages on: push: branches: - main pull_request: jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-22.04 concurrency: group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }} steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: true fetch-depth: 0 - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;latest\u0026#39; extended: true # use Hugo extended version - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 if: github.ref == \u0026#39;refs/heads/main\u0026#39; with: personal_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_BLOG}} # replace with your own token external_repository: ryanwooa/ryanwooa.github.io # replace with your own repository publish_dir: ./public #cname: www.example.com # custom domain secrets.PERSONAL_BLOG is a personal access token that is generated in the Settings-\u0026gt;Developer settings-\u0026gt;Personal access tokens of the personal account, and requires the repo and workflow permissions.\nAnd you need to add the secrets in the repository settings: Settings-\u0026gt;Secrets for automatic deployment of Hugo Blog to GitHub Pages.\n7.2 Publish to Github Pages After completing the above configuration, every time you modify the article locally, you only need to push the modification to the GitHub repository, and GitHub Action will deploy the web page generated by Hugo to the gh-pages branch of the Github Pages repository.\nSet the deploy branch to gh-pages in the settings of the Github Pages repository, so you can access your blog through https://username.github.io.\n8.
